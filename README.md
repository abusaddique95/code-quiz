# code-quiz

A project based on a code quiz

# Technologies

HTML
CSS
Javascript

# HTML

initial page was designed on html with classes and IDs given to specific elements to target them later in JS. snippets were used from bootstrap to help the process.

# Deployed URL

https://abusaddique95.github.io/day-planner-project/

# CSS

used CSS to style the way i wanted the page to look before rendering everything on JS dynamically. class names were targeted in JS to style the page correctly.

# Javascript

used javascript to dynamically render the HTML elements and have functions be called on load of the page. local storage was initialised in order to save the functions which were entered into the planner.

functions were created and called in order to run the page smoothly. sections were removed and new sections appeared to make it look like a smooth transition.

a timer was added and counted down once the quiz started. if a question was answered incorrectly it would deduct 5 seconds from the time.

certain functions were called if the timer ran out or a form was rendered if the quiz was completed before. scores were saved in local storage.
